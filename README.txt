Generate Random Polygon

Simply run the file through the command line to produce geogebra compatable files for randomly generated polygons.
Upon running the user will be prompted with 4 options: Quick Generation, Bulk Generation, Advanced Generation, and Quit

Quick generation makes a polygon with a user defined number of vertices using the GRP_CH heuristic with the x and y scale 
equal to the number of vertices. Outputs one file with labels and one without.

Bulk generation makes a user defined number of polygons with a user defined number of vertices using the GRP_CH heuristic 
with x and y scale equal to the number of vertices. Outputs files based on the user's selection.

Advanced generation allows the user to choose how many polygons to create, the method of generation, x and y scale, variation 
in the number of vertices (bulk only) and what kinds of files to output.
